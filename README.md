This project aims to increase the level of abstraction, bringing the _low-level_ HTTP API to _mid-level_
developers by providing an HTTP Client which is thoroughly tested and fully type-safe.

> Similarly to the **EDC Connector**, this library is at its early stage.
> It aims to maintain compatibility with the latest version of the _Connector_, currently `0.2.0`.
> The compatibility is reflected in the library's versioning.
