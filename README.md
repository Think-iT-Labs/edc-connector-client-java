## Description

The EDC Connector Client library for Java is a simple, easy and with minimum dependencies amount library to interact with 
[EDC Connector Management API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/eclipse-edc-bot/management-api)

Features:
 - JSON-LD expansion/compaction processes done under the hood of the class model.
 - Straightforward error handling.
 - Configurable http interceptors to customize the calls made to the connector.

## Requirements
- Java 17 or higher

## Installation

The library is published on [maven central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.think-it/edc-connector-client)
Choose the latest version and add it as a dependency in your favorite build automation tool.

## Usage
Everything evolves around the `EdcConnectorClient` that can be instantiated through the `Builder`:
```java
var client = EdcConnectorClient.newBuilder()
    .managementUrl("http://your.connector/management/api")
    .build();
```

From that `client` object the context specific endpoint services can be obtained:
- `assets()`
- `policyDefinitions()`
- `contractDefinitions()`
- `contractNegotiations()`
- `contractAgreements()`
- `transferProcesses()`
- `dataplanes()`
- `applicationObservability()`
- `catalogs()`
